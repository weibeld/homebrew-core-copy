# weibeld's Homebrew tap

This is a [Homebrew tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) with my personal Homebrew formulas.

## Usage

You can install any formula in this tap with:

```bash
brew install weibeld/core/<formula>
```

The above command installs the tap (`weibeld/core`) and the formula (`<formula>`) in a single step.

Alternatively, you can install only the tap with:

```bash
brew tap weibeld/core
```

And once the tap is installed, you can install all the formulas in this tap with:

```bash
brew install <formula>
```
